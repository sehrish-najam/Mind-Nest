# Mind-Nest
MindNest is a mobile-first mental wellness app designed as part of a two-member academic project. The app helps users track moods, log sleep, journal thoughts, and engage in calming routines like breathing exercises. The focus of the project was entirely on UI design, user flows, and building a fully interactive high-fidelity prototype using Figma.
