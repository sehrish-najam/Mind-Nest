# Mind-Nest
MindNest is a mobile-first mental wellness app designed as part of a two-member academic project. The app helps users track moods, log sleep, journal thoughts, and engage in calming routines like breathing exercises. The focus of the project was entirely on UI design, user flows, and building a fully interactive high-fidelity prototype using Figma.

#UI Design Highlights

#Calming Visual Aesthetic
Soft pastel color palette chosen to evoke calm and emotional safety, with rounded buttons and gentle shadows for a friendly, approachable feel. Generous white space throughout the layout to reduce visual clutter and improve focus.

#Iconography & Usability
Simple, universally recognized icons used for core actions to ensure intuitive navigation. Custom icons designed to match the app's theme and tone, with all icons clearly labeled to help users understand their function at a glance.

#Layout & Structure
Auto Layout used extensively in Figma to maintain alignment, spacing, and responsiveness across screens. Modular card-based components for mood tracking, journaling, and breathing exercises.

#Accessibility Focus
High contrast text and scalable fonts for readability. Tap-friendly buttons and simplified navigation for ease of use. Designed with WCAG guidelines in mind to support a wide range of users.
